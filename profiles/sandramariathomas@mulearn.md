#### Leadership and Influence:

I was part of the IT Fest conducted in our college and also was the coordinator of Coding competition in the same event.

#### Networking:

When it comes to influencing and leading others, my strength lies in sharing knowledge and insights. I aim to provide clear, concise, and reliable information that can empower others. 
Whether itâ€™s through detailed explanations, examples, or step-by-step guides, I strive to make complex concepts more understandable and accessible.

#### Career Plan:

My immediate career plan is to get into an entry-level position in an industrial setting where I can apply the theoretical knowledge that I have gained over 
my academics. Later, as the career progresses, after 2-3 years, I want to be at a mid-senior level,and  I would like to see myself in a leadership position 
where I could mentor new graduates who follow a similar or a better path I have come over.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has immense potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem; it can be achieved by making the government policies lenient, 
Promoting STEM education, and Promoting diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity, and background fosters creativity and innovation.
