# ANASWARA P

### About Me
Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong passion for coding and development. I have done a course on embedded system from Vector, Bangalore, where I acquired practical skills in C, C++, Embedded C, DSA, Communication Protocols and stimulation tools like  Proteus and Keil. During my internship, I contributed to real-world projects and learned directly from industry professionals, enhancing my hands-on experience.

| *Data Acquisition System*  |This project was implemented using UART, SPI and 12C protocols. The system measures the real-time value of pressure, temperature and and light intensity of the atmosphere and displays it on the screen. The microcontroller communicates with each sensor to acquire data. Each sensor sends the measured values (pressure, temperature, light intensity) back to the microcontroller using their respective communication protocols. The microcontroller processes the received data. This might include filtering, averaging, and converting raw sensor data into meaningful values. And the values are displaced on the screen.

| *Easy Go: Bus pass using QRCode scanner*  | The Android software is designed to enhance the efficiency of the bus ticketing procedure by generating unique QR codes for each registered passenger. These QR codes act as virtual bus passes, eliminating the need for physical paper tickets and enabling quick and easy ticket verification. Passengers register via the Android application by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and travel preferences.
The application securely stores this information in a database. The software generates a unique QR code for each passenger.     |  [Hosted Link 2]|    [Repo Link 2]
