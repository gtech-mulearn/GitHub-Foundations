### About Me

> Hello! I'm Vidhu Krishnan, a passionate and driven individual with a BSc in Computer Science and Data Science. With a solid foundation in both fields, I've spent the past few months gaining hands-on experience as a Junior Data Scientist, where I've honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.My journey in the world of data science has been exhilarating so far, and I'm eager to continue exploring new technologies and methodologies to tackle complex data challenges.

| **Traffic sign Detection using deep learning**  |   Traffic Sign Detection is like having a super smart friend in your car or on the road. It uses special cameras and clever computer programs to "read" and understand road signs. So, when you're driving and you miss a speed limit sign or a stop sign.It is implemented by using Convolutional Neural Network(Deep Learning)                                            | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Helmet Rule Violation**  | Addressing the increasing traffic accidents involving motorcyclists is crucial for public safety.Implementing regulations and promoting awareness, such as requiring helmet use, is a positive step. Your computer vision system using TensorFlow and Keras to detect helmet usage is innovative and could contribute significantly to enforcing safety measures. This technology has the potential to enhance compliance and ultimately save lives by preventing severe head injuries in case of accidents.                                             | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
