### About Me

> I'm a Tech enthusiast and a Designer. I started creating graphic designs for technical forums like IEEE, PRODDEC CEC, and much more inside and outside college and that's where my journey in graphic design began. From there I shifted my path to web designing. I've experimented with several languages and frameworks. I'm good at C programming, HTML, CSS, and Python. I've been a Linux user from the beginning and experimented with various Linux distributions. Being a part of IEEE Kerala Section SIGHT and IEEE CEC SIGHT for the past few years allowed me to engage in community projects. My career foresight is not only limited to graphic design or web designing but also to ethical hacking, electrical, and electronics fields. I enjoy working with communities and have been part of many community projects.
