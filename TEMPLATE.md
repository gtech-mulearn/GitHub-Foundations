#### Leadership and Influence:

- As an active member of the National Service Scheme (NSS) and a former member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), I have consistently demonstrated leadership and influencing skills. During my tenure with the NSS, I organized and led multiple community service initiatives, including environmental clean-up drives and educational workshops, inspiring my peers to participate and make a tangible impact in our community. My role as a class representative further honed my leadership abilities; I effectively communicated the concerns and suggestions of my classmates to the faculty, facilitating a better learning environment. Additionally, my involvement with IEEE allowed me to collaborate on technical projects and host seminars, showcasing my ability to influence and motivate my peers towards academic and professional growth. These experiences collectively highlight my capacity to lead, inspire, and effect positive change within my domain.

#### Networking:

-My networking skills have been significantly developed through my active involvement with the National Service Scheme (NSS) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). As an IEEE member, I attended numerous conferences, seminars, and workshops, where I connected with industry professionals, academicians, and fellow students. These interactions not only expanded my professional network but also provided opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects and exchange knowledge. Similarly, my participation in NSS activities allowed me to engage with diverse community groups and leaders, fostering relationships built on mutual respect and shared goals. Moving forward, I plan to leverage these networks to engage with the community by organizing technical and social initiatives that address both local and professional needs. By drawing on my extensive connections and experience, I will influence and lead others by exemplifying the importance of community involvement and professional development, thereby inspiring my peers to contribute meaningfully to our field and society at large.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate plan to contribute to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem begins with securing a position in the web development field, where I aim to apply my skills and knowledge to help local startups build robust and innovative web solutions. By working closely with emerging businesses, I will gain valuable industry experience and insights into the unique challenges and opportunities within the Kerala startup landscape. In the longer term, my goal is to become a full stack web developer, which will enable me to take on more comprehensive and technically demanding projects. As a full stack developer, I plan to mentor aspiring developers, lead collaborative projects, and introduce cutting-edge technologies to enhance the digital capabilities of startups in Kerala. By continuously upgrading my skills and sharing my expertise, I aim to foster a culture of innovation and technical excellence, significantly contributing to the growth and success of the Kerala Startup Ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and I am both excited and optimistic about its future. The state has made significant strides in fostering a conducive environment for startups and tech innovation, with initiatives like the Kerala Startup Mission providing essential support and resources. The ecosystem is characterized by a strong emphasis on education, a collaborative community, and a growing number of incubators and accelerators. From my perspective, this nurturing environment presents immense opportunities for budding entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts like myself. The blend of traditional industries and modern technology is creating a unique landscape where innovative solutions can thrive. I am eager to be part of this dynamic ecosystem, contribute to its growth, and witness Kerala emerge as a significant player in the global tech arena.


#### History of Community Engagement:

- My history of community engagement in a technical capacity has been extensive and fulfilling, particularly through my participation in IEEE programs. As an IEEE member, I actively engaged in various technical forums, seminars, and workshops where I contributed to discussions and shared my knowledge on emerging technologies.
