| **Indian sign language detection using images**  | The project focused on live Indian Sign Language detection and comparing CNN models (ConvNeXtSmall and DenseNet121) in this context, Using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pandas, data visualization libraries and etc. The main challenge was the lack of standard datasets for Indian Sign Language. To address this, I manually constructed a dataset for training the models. |   | https://github.com/iknoul/Indian-sign-language-detection-using-images-           |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have had some recent opportunities to demonstrate my leadership skills. I was the team lead for a three-member team on a live project using the MERN stack. This experience allowed me to understand each team member's weaknesses and strengths, motivate them effectively, and solve complex problems together as a team. I believe every person has different abilities and perspectives, and using this diversity effectively will lead the firm to higher levels.
#### Networking:

-I love being among people who share similar passions and have different ideas. It not only helps to grow our professional skills and techniques but also reduces stress levels, making my career more enjoyable and fulfilling.  

#### Career Plan:

- start a startup after gaining sufficient experience and financial strength.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- It's rapidly growing with expanding infrastructure and opportunities, but there are far more people than the industry can accommodate. It seems like it will neutralize the proportion.
